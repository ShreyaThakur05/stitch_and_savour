# Stitch & Savour - Issues Fixed & Enhancements

## 🔧 **Issues Identified & Fixed**

### 1. **Orders Not Reflecting in Admin Dashboard** ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** Orders were only being saved to localStorage and not to the MongoDB database, causing them to not appear in the admin dashboard.

**Root Cause:** 
- `orderController.js` was only processing notifications but not saving orders to database
- Admin dashboard was only reading from localStorage
- No proper integration between frontend order service and backend API

**Solutions Implemented:**

#### Backend Changes:
- **Updated `orderController.js`:**
  - Now properly saves orders to MongoDB using the Order model
  - Calculates estimated delivery based on product type (crochet: 14 days, food: 2 days)
  - Stores customer info, delivery address, and order items correctly
  - Maintains notification system for email/SMS

- **Enhanced `dashboardController.js`:**
  - Fetches real orders from MongoDB instead of returning mock data
  - Calculates proper statistics (total sales, today's sales, pending orders, etc.)
  - Provides unique customer count and profit calculations

#### Frontend Changes:
- **Updated `AdminDashboard.js`:**
  - Now fetches orders from API endpoint `/orders/all`
  - Maintains localStorage fallback for offline functionality
  - Properly handles order status updates via API
  - Shows both database orders and local orders

- **Enhanced `orderService.js`:**
  - Integrates with backend API for order creation and retrieval
  - Maintains localStorage backup for offline access
  - Added `getAllOrders()` method for admin dashboard
